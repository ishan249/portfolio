      Love to read books about life, love and mystery and essays about system design, how tech team in a company works and everything around it. Other than this I tweet random and some amazing things on <a href="https://twitter.com/Ishanp249" target="_blank">twitter</a> and I really love Reddit, it is the best and my favourite social media platform. That is pretty much all things about me.
